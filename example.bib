@article{Zhong2009,
	abstract = {Introduction of a time-accurate stabilized finite-element approximation for the numerical investigation of fully nonlinear shallow-water waves is presented in this paper. To make the time approximation match the order of accuracy of the spatial representation of the triangular elements by the Galerkin method, the fourth-order time integration of implicit multistage Pad{\'{e}} method is used for the development of the numerical scheme. The Streamline-Upwind Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) method with cross-wind diffusion is employed to stabilize the scheme and suppress the spurious oscillations, usually common in the numerical computation of convection dominated flow problems. The performance of numerical stabilization and accuracy is addressed. Numerical results obtained for cases representing propagation of solitary waves, collisions of two solitary waves, and wave-structure interactions show fairly good agreement with experimental measurements and other published numerical solutions. The comparisons between results from present fully nonlinear wave model and weekly nonlinear wave model are presented and discussed.},

@article{An2012,
	abstract = {A well-balanced shallow water flow model on quadtree cut cell grids is presented. The Cartesian cut cell method is applied due to its flexibility in treating curvilinear boundaries. In order to preserve a lake-at-rest and the positivity of water depths in drying/wetting zones, the hydrostatic reconstruction proposed by Audusse et al. [1] is implemented on cut cell grids. In addition, the gradient construction method on cut cells proposed by Causon et al. [8] is modified due to the spurious calculation when a solid boundary is nearly parallel to grids. The numerical schemes mentioned above are employed in Gerris which is open source free software and provides a shallow water solver on adaptive quadtree grids. The applied numerical schemes are validated using four test simulations: still water in an inclined domain; oscillation in a parabolic container; shock reflection by a circular cylinder; flash flood experiment in a model city. The simulation results are compared with analytical solutions, experiment data and the results simulated by other researchers.},

@article{Xie2019,
	abstract = {The hydrodynamic forces on coastal structures impacted by tsunami depend on the wave Froude number, the sizes and shapes of the structures and also on whether the structures stand in water or on dry land at the time of the impact. We conducted simulations using shallow-water hydraulic equations and then simulations using full Navier-Stokes equations to determine the wave impact on a vertical wall – i.e., a structure of infinite width – and a structure of finite width. In the case of steep waves on a wet bed, the wave-drag coefficient rose to a peak on impact and then settled to a wave-structure interaction equilibrium. In the case of smooth waves on dry land, the approach to the equilibrium was gradual. The numerical simulations determined the dependence of the wave-drag coefficients on the Froude number and the width-to-depth ratio for waves on wet beds and, separately, for waves on dry land. The simulations also reproduced the wave forces for the range of conditions observed in the laboratory.},

Instead of testing all neighboring cells for strong shocks we test the Riemann problem for contact and shear waves. As an indicator we suggest the residual of the Rankine–Hugoniot condition for the linear waves. By using known approaches, we can apply a well tempered amount of viscosity for the contact and shear waves of the Roe and HLLEM methods. The resulting Riemann solver approximates contact and shear waves exactly. However, according to the chosen value of a parameter, the Carbuncle phenomenon can be completely avoided.},
